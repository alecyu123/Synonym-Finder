## Project 3 Information

# Create a dictionary equal to the word you are comparing, "Query Word", the key being the words that you are comparing the Query word to, call it "Related Word", and the value being the number of times a word is related to the Query Word (or used in the same sentence), this being the associated number to Related Word.

# Therefore our dictionaries will look like dog = {man: 5, canine: 10, bone: 30}

# We use the cosine length to relate how close the vectors that represent the Query Words are together (as an angle) in the Related Word space.
